# ANALYSIS ON BREAST CANCER DATASET
### Hello folks, myself SANSKAR VASHIST, and this is a PROJECT + STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE on how I (and you) can train a MACHINE LEARNING MODEL on a BREAST CANCER CLASSIFICATION DATASET.

### This dataset contains measurements from digitized images of FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATES (FNA) of breast masses. Each sample is described using 30 numerical features that help classify the tumor as BENIGN (B) or MALIGNANT (M).

#### M--> CANCERCEROUS
#### B-->NON-CANCEROUS

### From DATA PREPROCESSING to MODEL TRAINING and HYPERPARAMETER TUNING, youâ€™ll get a complete walkthrough.

### I used SVC (SUPPORT VECTOR CLASSIFIER) to train the model. Other models like K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS and RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER were also explored, but SVC PERFORMED BEST.

### Initially, the model achieved around 94% ACCURACY, and after tuning, it improved to 98.2%.
